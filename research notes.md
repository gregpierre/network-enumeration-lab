# Day 1 – Network Security Research Notes

## What Attackers Can Discover:
- Active devices on a network
- Open ports (TCP/UDP)
- Services running on ports (SSH, HTTP, FTP, etc.)
- OS information (sometimes)
- Unencrypted traffic data
- Network structure

## Tools To Explore:
- Nmap – for scanning open ports and discovering services
- Wireshark – for capturing and analyzing packets

## Questions / Thoughts:
- Can I capture my own local traffic safely?
- How do I scan a VM vs my main computer?
